## What?
CRAB is official Flemish open data. It is a dataset which contains all official addresses in Flanders (Belgium).

This extension brings new classes:
* CrabCity
* CrabStreet
* CrabAddress

There's also a scheduled process to import that data into iTop, so you can link Crab Addresses to certain classes.

This extension requires jb-map (pro extension).

## Cookbook

XML:
* create new classes CrabStreet and CrabAddress

PHP:
* nothing

## Requirements
This extension relies on the iTop extension "jb-map".
