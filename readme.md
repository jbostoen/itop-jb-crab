## What?
CRAB is official Flemish open data. It is a dataset which contains all official addresses in Flanders (Belgium).

This extension brings new classes:
* CrabAddress
* CrabStreet
* CrabCity

There's also a scheduled process to import that data into iTop, so you can link Crab Addresses to certain classes.

* iTop extensions
  * [jb-framework](https://github.com/jbostoen/itop-jb-framework) Framework
  * [jb-map](https://github.com/jbostoen/itop-jb-pro-extensions) Map extension
  
* OGR2OGR
  * In Linux environments: install ogr2ogr
  * In Windows environments: add the folder where ogr2ogr.exe is located to the system environment variable named 'path'

* needs write permissions: env-production/jb-crab/app/common/download . The data set will be downloaded here.

## Cookbook

* create new classes

PHP:
* implementing a scheduled process
